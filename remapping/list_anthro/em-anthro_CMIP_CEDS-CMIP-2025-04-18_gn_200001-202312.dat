# Species mapping file for CEDSv2021
# Contains three parts 
# (1) File locations & species setup
# Note "SPC" in Destination_fileformat, "SPC" will be replaced by CESM species name
# (2) mapping equations (yields can be either mass or molar yield)
# Format: CESM_species[molecular weight] = yield*emission_inventory_species mass/molar sector vert
# (3) molecular weights of species for emission species 
# -> this is for the case that original emission files have wrong molecular weights or no information.
